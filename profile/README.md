The CHIPS project (Clinical Health Imaging Portability Standards) is a federally funded initiative to deploy an MRI phantom, software, training program and support to calibrate MRI scans system wide (over 100 scanner sites). The project provides a comprehensive MRI phantom-based hardware and software solution to provide, for the first time, comprehensive calibrated measurements for MRI and quantitative quality assessment (QQA) across scanners.
